# News Reaper
This News Reaper App is made with the help of React Js and Bootstrap and NewsApi.
<br>
It is a responsive app optimised for both desktop and mobile phones. <br>
It is a single page application with an amazing light and dark mode switch.
<br> 
## Since NewsAPI restrics hosting of app I had to create a static copy of the app with recorded data from JSON file.
*news-reaper* repository contains code which uses API to fetch data. <br>
**news-reaper-static** contains code for the recorded data website with a live preview.
<br>

Light Mode:
